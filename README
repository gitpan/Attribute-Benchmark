NAME
    Attribute::Benchmark - dead easy benchmarking

SYNOPSIS
       #!/usr/bin/env perl
   
       use Attribute::Benchmark;
   
       sub foo :Benchmark
       {
          1 for 0..10;
       }
   
       sub bar1 :Benchmark(bar)
       {
          1 for 0..1000;
       }

    That's all folks!

DESCRIPTION
    Attribute::Benchmark provides a `:Benchmark` attribute for subs. Just
    import it into a script, write the subs you wish to compare, and add the
    `:Benchmark` attribute to each. Then run your script.

    No need to `use strict` or `use warnings` - Attribute::Benchmark does that
    for you.

    By default Attribute::Benchmark uses `cmpthese(-3, \%subs)` but the
    iteration count can be changed in the import statement:

       use Attribute::Benchmark (100);

    Don't forget the parentheses; otherwise Perl will assume you want version
    100.0 of Attribute::Benchmark!

    Attribute::Benchmark will use the name of the sub as the label for the
    benchmark results (e.g. "foo" above). But you can provide an explicit
    label for a result like:

       sub bar1 :Benchmark(bar)

    Easy, peasy, lemon squeezy.
